  {
    id: 'alien', name: 'The Alien and the Other', sector: 'contact',
    summary: 'The genre’s oldest way of thinking about difference: imagine a mind that did not evolve on Earth, then see what meeting it does to ours. Aliens run from invaders that mirror human empires to intelligences no human concept can reach.',
    questions: [
      'Could we recognize a mind built on different principles from ours?',
      'Is the alien a mirror for human others: the colonized, the stranger, the enemy?',
      'What do we owe a being we cannot understand?'
    ],
    motifs: ['invasion', 'the benevolent overlord', 'the incomprehensible ocean', 'the language barrier', 'the abandoned artifact', 'the dark forest'],

  },
  {
    id: 'made-minds', name: 'Artificial Minds', sector: 'ai',
    summary: 'From Frankenstein’s creature to Murderbot, the made mind asks what makes a person and what a maker owes what it makes. Robots begin as figures of labour and revolt; AIs become gods, slaves, children and colleagues.',
    questions: [
      'Can consciousness be built, or does it have to be grown?',
      'Who is responsible when a created being suffers, or does harm?',
      'Would an artificial mind want anything we want?'
    ],
    motifs: ['creator and creation', 'the robot revolt', 'the Three Laws', 'the empathy test', 'the AI that escapes its box', 'the companion machine'],

  },
  {
    id: 'time', name: 'Time, Causality and Other Histories', sector: 'time',
    summary: 'Wells turned time into a direction you could travel in. Later writers used the device to test free will, causality and the fragility of history, and alternate history asks the same questions without a machine at all.',
    questions: [
      'Can the past be changed, and if so, which present is the real one?',
      'Is history driven by individuals, by accidents or by deep forces?',

  },
  {
    id: 'control', name: 'Power, Surveillance and the State', sector: 'dystopia',
    summary: 'The dystopia takes the tendencies of the present and carries them to their end. Some regimes rule through fear and watching; others through pleasure, comfort or the management of bodies.',
    questions: [
      'How does a society persuade people to accept their own control?',
      'What is lost when privacy goes, and who gains from it?',
      'Where does resistance come from once the past has been rewritten?'
    ],
    motifs: ['the all-seeing state', 'rewritten history', 'conditioning', 'the controlled language', 'the rebel who reads', 'reproductive control'],

  },
  {
    id: 'better-worlds', name: 'Utopia and the Better World', sector: 'utopia',
    summary: 'Utopias are arguments about how to live, written as places. The modern form admits its doubts: Le Guin subtitled hers “an ambiguous utopia”, and Delany answered with “an ambiguous heterotopia”.',
    questions: [
      'What would have to change about property, work, family and power?',
      'Can a perfect society survive contact with real people?',

  },
  {
    id: 'catastrophe', name: 'Catastrophe and Survival', sector: 'apoc',
    summary: 'The end of the world is rarely the end of the story. Apocalyptic fiction clears the stage to ask what people keep, what they rebuild, and who they become when institutions fail.',
    questions: [
      'What knowledge is worth saving, and who gets to save it?',
      'Does collapse reveal human nature or remake it?',

  },
  {
    id: 'planet', name: 'Ecology and the Living Planet', sector: 'eco',
    summary: 'Dune made a planet’s ecology the engine of its plot. Climate fiction now writes about the planet we already live on, where the catastrophe is gradual, political and partly our own doing.',

      'How do environments shape cultures, beliefs and power?',
      'Can a technological civilization live within the limits of its world?',

  },
  {
    id: 'beyond-human', name: 'Becoming Something Else', sector: 'posthuman',

  },
  {
    id: 'identity', name: 'Gender, Race and Who Gets a Future', sector: 'identity',
    summary: 'SF can change one variable in a human society and watch what follows. Writers have used it to unsettle gender, expose the logic of race, and imagine futures written from outside the genre’s old centre.',

  },
  {
    id: 'empire', name: 'Empire and Colonization', sector: 'opera',
    summary: 'Space opera borrowed the shapes of earthly empires: navies, provinces, frontiers and subject peoples. Its best work asks who the frontier belonged to before the settlers arrived.',

  },
  {
    id: 'war', name: 'War and the Soldier', sector: 'military',

    questions: [
      'Is war a test of virtue, or a machine that consumes people?',

  },
  {
    id: 'networks', name: 'Networks, Simulation and the Self', sector: 'cyber',
    summary: 'Once minds can live in machines, reality becomes a design problem. Cyberpunk tied this to corporate power and street life, and later writers followed the network into everyday life.',

  },
  {
    id: 'language', name: 'Language and Thought', sector: 'inner',
    summary: 'A favourite SF experiment is to change a language and watch the mind change with it. These stories dramatize the idea that the words we have shape what we are able to think.',
    questions: [
      'Could learning a language change how you experience time, gender or the self?',

  },
  {
    id: 'wonder', name: 'Deep Time and Cosmic Scale', sector: 'hard',
    summary: 'SF is the literature that can make a reader feel the size of the universe and the length of time. Its “sense of wonder” comes from scale: billion-year histories, structures larger than worlds, the end of everything.',
    questions: [
      'How does humanity look against billions of years?',
